# EmoteMe!

Small cooperative game in which a pair of robots must solve puzzles in order to escape from their suffering.

Game for two people in which each player must control one of the robots and cooperate to solve the multiple puzzles in each level.

For a complete experience players should not communicate verbally with each other during the game.

Highly recommended to play with a controller.

GDSG Game for Intrinsic Game Jam.
